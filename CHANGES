VERSION 2.0.5 -- 2009.12.24
* Fixed bug where files could load recursively
* Fixed typo that caused some argument parser patterns to fail

VERSION 2.0.4 -- 2009.12.20
* Fixed bug where single value optional positional arguments would not be parsed properly
* Fixed bug with Windows path separators in q.q code
* Lists can be specified as default values
* Made option parser capable of handling single value optional positional arguments (only one value is processed instead of whole list)

VERSION 2.0.3 -- 2009.11.06
* Added a boolean DEBUG flag
* Made option parser disregard option errors if DEBUG flag is true

VERSION 2.0.2 -- 2009.09.17
* Fixed bug where wrong error was being thrown when processing improperly formatted option files
* Fixed bug where leading and trailing tab spaces would appear in option keys

VERSION 2.0.1 -- 2009.09.10
* Added support for optional positional arguments (enlist 0) eg start a command with a list of directories or leave it empty and begin processing the current directory

VERSION 2.0 -- 2009.09.09
* Significantly enhanced functionality of option parser.  Breaks backwards compatibility
** New .utl.addDefOpt allows a default value to be specified for an option
** New .utl.addArg allows positional arguments to be specified
** NONCOMPATIBLE - Options and arguments must now be finalized by calling .utl.parseArgs with an optional string value
*** Any command line arguments that are not handled will cause an error to be raised.
*** If the command line fails, a detailed description of the command line and available options will be printed
* Fixed bug with config file parser where empty lines would cause the parser to fail an error to be raised.  Empty lines (blank or only white-space) are now ignored

VERSION 1.1 -- 2009.07.24
* Made loader capable of handling nested packages more robustly
* Made loader capable of detecting conflicting required package versions

VERSION 1.0 -- 2009.07.22
* NONCOMPATIBLE - Changed package-name/version number separator from '.' to '-'
* Fixed bug where some version numbers would be incorrectly seen as larger (ie: 1.11 was greater than 2.0)
* Added init.q file to qutil library, does *not* load bootstrap.q
* Added config_parse code to parse INI style files (should be able to parse same files as Python's ConfigParser module)

VERSION 0.1 -- 2009.05.25
* Initial Version
